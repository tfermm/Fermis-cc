Just some computercraft things

harvester.lua

This lua script is ment to hover over crops and patroll a field.
When a crop is grown it will break it and replace it.

There is a list of crops the turtle will harvest currently hard coded in.

Supported seeds:

Magical Crops
Minecraft Crops

TODO:
Finish adding in Magical crops seeds into the whitelist
make whitelist configurable
finish adding in minecraft seeds

**Known bugs**
When the turtle goes over a non-whitelisted item the program crashes
